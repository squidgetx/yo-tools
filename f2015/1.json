Did you know that as a member of Yale Outdoors you have rental privileges with YO’s fully stocked Gear Room? The Gear Room has a wide variety of outdoor equipment including tents, hiking packs, sleeping bags, headlamps, hammocks, rock climbing equipment, and much more. All of this is available to you for rental at very low prices whether you are going on a YO-led trip or a personal adventure. The Gear Room will soon have a website that can be used to check out gear, but until that is fully up and running in a few weeks all rental inquiries should be addressed to the YO Gear Manager at max.farbman@yale.edu.</p>",

It is YO Co-Coordinator Emeritus Rafi Bildner's favorite outdoor film of all time. Join us at <b>8 p.m.</b> at the <b>YO house (229 Dwight St.)</b>. Weather permitting, we'll show it in the backyard and enjoy some s'mores around a fire pit after the movie is over.",

This route travels 23 miles over 9,000ft of elevation gain across a striking ridgeline connecting many of the highest peaks in the Northeastern US. We will be doing it in a single night, under a nearly full moon – starting around nightfall on Saturday, and finishing early Sunday morning to enjoy an alpine sunrise. This itinerary demands exceptional fitness and the ability to quickly and safely navigate rocky, steep terrain at night. (Note: this trip is during Parents Weekend)."
